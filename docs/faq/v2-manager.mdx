# (V2) Manager App/Site FAQ

## Is FNS only for storing an Filecoin address?
No, you can store the addresses of over 100 blockchains, decentralized website, profile information such as an avatar and Twitter handle, and more.

 - Store addresses of over 100 blockchains
 - Point to a decentralized website
 - Store profile information, avatar and links to social media profiles

## Can I point an FNS name to my regular website?
Though FNS can technically store anything, there aren't many third-party tools and applications which resolve IP addresses attached to FNS.

Instead, we suggest hosting your static html/css/images on IPFS and put the hash in your FNS Name's [Content record](/core/records/content-hash).

Then it can be resolved by FNS-aware browsers:
 - Brave
 - Opera

Browser extensions:
Metamask

Or in any browser by appending `.link` or `.limo` to the end of the FNS name. For example: `snowowl.fil.limo`

## Redirect to a Web2 page
If you want to redirect your FNS name to a web2 website you could write a simple html-file containing a redirect to your web2 website address and upload it to IPFS. Then you can put the IPFS CID of the html file your FNS Name's [Content record](/core/records/content-hash)

# What is the maximum length of a name I can register?
There is no limit on the name length. Technically speaking the transaction would have to fit within an Filecoin block, but it would take *a lot* to reach that size.

# Can I register names other than .fil?
Yes, you can *link* any DNS name with FNS provided it supports `DNSSEC and you can prove ownership of it by creating a `TXT record` under it pointing to your Filecoin wallet address.

# Can I register a name with emojis?
Yes.[^emoji1]
[^emoji1]: Emoji from Emoji 14.0 are not yet supported, but will be once the new name normalization rules are implemented.

# Registration FAQ

## At Step 1, the transaction was slow so I speeded it up
Our app cannot currently detect that you sped up the transaction. Please refresh the page and start from step 1 again.

## I am stuck at Step 2
At times, the counter waits for up to a minute at the end of step 2 to make sure that the Filecoin blockchain has progressed. If this continues for more than 5 min after moving to step 2, please contact us on Discord.
Note that if you leave it at step 2 for more than 7 days, it gets reset and you have to start from step 1 again.

## My transaction at Step 3 failed
This happens occasionally when the USD price changes and you haven't registered with enough FIL. Please try again from step 3.
Please also be noted that the registration step will expire if you don't complete within 24 hrs and you have to start from step 1 again.

## I cannot see the names I registered on OpenSea nor on my wallet
This occasionally happens when OpenSea is under a heavy load. You may also not find your name under the NFT section of your wallet, as many wallets fetch metadata from OpenSea.
As long as you can see your registered name under "My Account" on our site or your FIL address under the name section, your name is registered successfully.

## Is it safe to refresh the page, close the browser, or switch to different browser/machine?

It is safe to refresh the page or close the browser once step 1 transaction is complete. However you cannot switch to different devices or machines because it needs a locally stored “secret” which will be used at step 3. Please also do not delete browser history during the registration.
After you register

## What is the difference between the Registrant and Controller?

If your Filecoin address is set as the Controller you can change the resolver and add/edit records. Some dapps (eg: Fleek, OpenSea) set themselves as the Controller so they can update records on your behalf.
The Registrant only exists on ".fil" names and it allows you to change the Controller. If you transfer the Registrant to an address you don't own, you lose the ownership of the name.


## What is a Resolver?

A Resolver is a smart contract that holds records. Names are set by default to the Public Resolver managed by the FNS team and have all the standard FNS record types. You can set your Resolver to a custom resolver contract if you,d like.
What is a Primary FNS Name record?

A Primary FNS Name record (formerly Reverse Record) makes your Filecoin address point to an FNS name. This allows dapps to find and display your FNS name when you connect to them with your Filecoin account. This can only be set by you so it is not set automatically upon registration.
To set the Primary FNS Name record, please click "My account", and select "Primary FNS Name".
How do I unregister my name?

If you click the "trash bin" icon on the address record, it will unset your address so that people can no longer look up your address with the name. You can also unset ownership of subdomains in this way, but you cannot do so on ".fil" addresses. Because ".fil" names are ERC721-compliant NFTs, you cannot transfer them to an empty address (0x00000...). You can transfer it to a burn address (eg: 0x00001), but that does not erase the fact that you used to own the name. Also, the name will not become available for registration again until the registration period and grace period runs out.
How do I transfer my name?

For a ".fil" name, transfer both the Registrant and the Controller to the new Filecoin account. Since ".fil" names are ERC721 compliant NFTs, you can change the Registrant by simply transferring the NFT from any NFT compliant wallet/marketplace as well.
Note that transferring the ownership (aka the Registrant) of the name does not change the controller nor records, so the recipient may need to update them once received. If the recipient is not experienced or you prefer your address not to be associated to the transferring names, it may be a good idea for you to set the FIL Address record to their Filecoin address, set the controller, then transfer the name.
For subdomains, there are no registrants unless the subdomain is customised to be ERC721 compliant. Simply set the controller to the new address (after setting the record to the new address).


## Why are some of my subdomains shown as a jumble of characters?

FNS names are stored as a hash on-chain so we have to decode the name using a list of possible names, and it shows in the hashed format if we don't have it on our list. You can still access and manage the name if you search for the name directly in the search bar.
How do I find the labelhash/namehash of a name?

Please refer to our developer documentation page.
When you extend your registration

## How do I receive an extension reminder?

Click the "Remind me" button on the name's page or your address page so that you can set a calendar reminder or email reminder. Note that you have to set calendar reminders per name, whereas you only need to set email reminders per the address of the owner. Also note that you can register a name for multiple years, removing the need to extend each year.
What happens if I forget to extend the registration of a name?

After your name expires, there is a 90 day grace period in which the owner can't edit the records but can still re-register the name. After the grace period, the name is released for registration by anyone with a temporary premium which decreases over a 21 days period. The released name continues to resolve your FIL address until the new owner overwrites it.
Where can I see the list of names to be released

You can see the list in the "FNS Names to be released" section of the Dune Analytics dashboard.


## I lost access to the Filecoin account that owns a name I registered. Can I still extend its registration period?

Any Filecoin account can pay to extend the registration of any FNS name, though doing so from an account that's not the owner will not change ownership of the name. Just go to the name's page and click "Extend".

## I registered names before 2019 May. Can I have my deposit back?

Yes, you can get your deposit back from reclaim.ens.domains whether you extended the registration of the name or not.

Please remember that the amount you will receive is the amount of the second-highest bidder (unless you were the only bidder). For example, if you bid 1 FIL and the second highest bidder bid 0.1 FIL, you deposited 0.1 FIL and you have already received the remaining (0.9 FIL) when you finalised the auction. Therefore you can now only reclaim 0.1 FIL back. Please read the initial guide back in 2017 for more detail.
