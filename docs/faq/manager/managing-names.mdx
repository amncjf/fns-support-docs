# Managing a name

## What records can I add? Is FNS only for storing an Filecoin address?
You can store the addresses of over 100 blockchains, a content hash of a decentralized website, profile information such as an avatar and Twitter handle, and more. FNS even allows you to create custom records that can be used by other applications.

## What is a Primary FNS name?
A Primary FNS Name (previously Reverse Record) points your Filecoin address to an FNS name. This allows dApps to find and display your FNS name when you connect to them with your Filecoin account. You can only have one primary name per address.

Sending money to an FNS name will resolve to the fil address record, and is not dependent on having a primary name set. However, your primary name must match your Filecoin address record.

To set or change your primary name, visit the settings page in the FNS app.

## How do I set up my profile?
FNS profiles are a collection of pre-defined records, which are used by other dApps. When connected to the FNS app and viewing a name you own, you will see an Edit Profile button on the Profile tab. Here you can update the specific records used for profiles.

## What are Managers and Owners?
The Owner is the ultimate owner of the name. For .fil names the Owner (formerly Registrant) of a name can change the Manager and transfer ownership. Not all names will have an owner. If you have PARENT_CANNOT_CONTROL burned as a subname, you will be considered the owner as the parent cannot take over your name.

The Manager (formerly Controller) of a name can change the resolver and add/edit records. Some dApps (eg: Fleek, OpenSea) set themselves as Manager so they can update records on your behalf. If your .fil name is wrapped, you will not have a Manager as these ownerships are now combined under just a single owner.

## How do I send my name to another address?
Sending your name to another address will let you transfer the Owner, Manager or both to a new Filecoin address. This can be done from the More tab when viewing a name you own.

Sending the name to another address will not update the records, or make it the primary name for the new address.

## What is a Resolver?
A Resolver is a smart contract that holds records. By default, names are set to the Public Resolver, which is developed and maintained by the FNS team and has all the standard FNS record types. This is recommended for most users, but you can use custom contracts if you'd like.

If you are using an older version of the resolver, you can upgrade it from within the FNS app in the More tab.

## What is the Name Wrapper?
Wrapping a name is an upgrade that gives older names access to more modern features, such as burnable permissions and ERC1155 NFT support. All newly registered names are wrapped by default.

If you do have an unwrapped name you will see a prompt to upgrade in the FNS app. This is of course optional, and your name will still work without it.

You can view a full list of feature [on Github](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/wrapper).

## How do I find the labelhash/namehash of a name?
Please refer to our [developer documentation page](https://docs.ens.domains/contract-api-reference/name-processing#how-do-i-find-the-labelhash-namehash-of-a-name).

## What is the difference between a name and a subname?
Both are names, however subnames have a parent name. For example with resolver.ens.fil, ens.fil is the name while resolver is the subname.

Subnames usually inherit the permissions of the parent name, however parent name owners can burn their permissions, giving subnames more control.

## What are permissions?
Permissions allow the owner of a parent name to remove their access to certain features on subnames. For example, by default only the parent name owner can transfer ownership of a subname. With permissions, the parent name owner can remove their ability to do so, allowing trustless subnames. Before burning any permissions, the name must first burn the ability to unwrap and the wrapper expiry must not be expired.
