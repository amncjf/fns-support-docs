## Lack of normalization
FNS Vision does not perform normalization when registering names which means that it's possible to register invalid names that will not be possible to manage, use or trade on certain marketplaces like OpenSea.

Before registering a name on FNS Vision *always* make sure it is searchable in the official <Link to="https://app.fildomains.com"><b>FNS Manager App</b></Link> first.
