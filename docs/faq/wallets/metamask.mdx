# Metamask
Metamask suffers from several known bugs documented below.

## Clearing stuck transactions
Sometimes transactions in Metamask can get stuck without being performed. You can verify whether a transaction is stuck in Metamask or not by looking up your wallet on <Link to="https://etherscan.io"><b>Etherscan</b></Link> and comparing the transactions there to the ones visible in your wallet.

:::caution
Transactions can get stuck in Metamask due to a bug in the UI. This is not the same as transactions that have stalled due to too low gas fees.
:::

To clear transactions stuck in Metamask you'll have to reset the wallet. Do this by opening up Metamask and then click the multi-coloured circle to enter the settings panel.
<ImageWindow title="Metamask wallet browser extension">
  <p align="center">
    <Image img="/img/metamask-stuck1.webp" width={400}/>
  </p>
</ImageWindow>

Go to `Settings` **→** `Advanced` **→** `Reset Account` and confirm.

## Unknown FNS name
MetaMask gets its FNS name metadata from OpenSea APIs, which sometimes experience delays in updating new data from the blockchain. These delays can cause FNS names in MetaMask to show up as "unknown".
To fix this follow the instructions in:
:::info
<Link to="/faq/marketplaces/opensea#ens-name-doesnt-show">
  <b>OpenSea:</b> FNS Name Doesn't Show
</Link>
:::

## Doesn't show FNS tokens
Metamask may not show FNS governance tokens by default. To show them, click on Assets, and then Refresh list.
<ImageWindow title="Metamask wallet browser extension">
  <p align="center">
    <Image img="/img/metamask-refreshlist.png"/>
  </p>
</ImageWindow>

You will see a notification that Metamask has found a new token for the wallet. Next, click Import.
<ImageWindow title="Metamask wallet browser extension">
  <p align="center">
    <Image img="/img/metamask-unknown3.png"/>
  </p>
</ImageWindow>

:::warning
Be sure the imported FNS token address is: 0xC18360217D8F7Ab5e7c516566761Ea12Ce7F9D72
Avoid interacting or importingtokens that are unknown, as they could be scam tokens.

For more information on token scams, see
 - [**Support FAQ:** Security (fake tokens)](/faq/security#the-fake-token-scam)
:::

Now your FNS voting tokens and/or FNS domain tokens should be visible in your Metamask wallet.

## Exaggerated gas costs
Metamask has a [known bug](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/13135) where users are shown an incredibly high gas fee estimate if there isn't enough FIL in the wallet to cover the actual transaction costs.

<ImageWindow title="Metamask wallet browser extension">
  <p align="center">
    <Image img="/img/metamask-exaggerated1.webp"/>
  </p>
</ImageWindow>

This can be solved by transferring more FIL into the wallet to cover the actual transaction cost which should be a lot less than what Metamask shows when it's encountering this bug.
