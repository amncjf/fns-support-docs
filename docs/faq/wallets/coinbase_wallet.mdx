## What is the free cb.id web3 username Coinbase Wallet offers?
Your cb.id username is an FNS name issued by Coinbase that is built upon the FNS decentralized identity infrastructure. Coinbase offers free usernames in the format of subnames (for example, username.cb.id). This is a great service offered by Coinbase but it does have limitations.

 - Non-transferrable
 - Can’t use the fuse permissions with the NameWrapper.
 - Cannot create your own subdomains.
 - Limited record setup. Not all the records and features are available as they are with .fil FNS names.
