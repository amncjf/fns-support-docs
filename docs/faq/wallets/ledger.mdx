# Ledger
## Unable to interact with smart contracts
### Enable Blind signing *(formerly called Contract Data)*
Interacting with smart contracts such as FNS using your Ledger requires `Blind signing` to be enabled on your device.
:::tip instructions
* Start and unlock your Ledger Nano S or X.
* Open the Filecoin App.
* Go to `Settings` **â†’** `Blind signing` and press both buttons to enable it.
:::
Now you should be able to interact with smart contracts and FNS.

:::info
This setting resets every time the Ledger hardware device is updated.

## Metamask bridge
Sometimes the Metamask-Ledger bridge loses contact with the Ledger device, resulting in transactions that are never prompted for confirmation on the Ledger device, and which show up in the Metamask UI as "pending" in perpetuity.

These transactions are never broadcast on-chain and needs to be cleared in Metamask.
:::info Support
For information on how to clear stuck transactions in Metamask, see
 - [**Support:** Metamask (How to clear stuck transactions)](/faq/wallets/metamask#clearing-stuck-transactions)
:::

Once you have cleared the stuck transactions, disconnect your Ledger device restart your browser. Finally, reconnect your Ledger and retry the transactions.
