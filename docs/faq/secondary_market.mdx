# Secondary markets
After purchasing an FNS name from a secondary marketplace it's important to keep a few things in mind:

 * The registration period is *inherited* from the previous owner, so double-check the expiration date using the [FNS Manager App](https://app.fildomains.com).
  
 * *Only* the `Owner` record is updated with your wallet address, all other records like the `Manager` and `FIL Address` records remain set to the old owner's address until you change it.

:::warning
Without updating the FIL Address, sending tokens to a name you've just purchased on a secondary market will most likely lead to a loss of funds. Be sure
the FNS name is not still pointing to the previous owner's wallet address.
