# Integrate a DNS name
FNS supports importing DNS names into FNS, which makes it possible to use, for example, your .com .net or .org DNS name with FNS. Allowing you to use nearly all features of an FNS name with your DNS name.

For example: Coinbase *.cb.id usernames are all issued under their `cb.id` DNS name that was imported into FNS!

There are a few pre-requisites to importing a DNS name into FNS:

 - **The DNS name must have DNSSEC enabled with RSA/SHA-256 or ECDSA keys**
 - **An _ens TXT record must be created on the DNS name containing the wallet address to prove ownership of it.**

:::info
You can only integrate existing DNS domain names that you own with FNS. You *cannot* create new domain names with non-existing
TLD's this way.

## Integrating a DNS name
Go to the <Link to="https://app.fildomains.com"><b>FNS Manager App</b></Link>, connect your wallet, search for your DNS domain name and click on it to continue.

</BrowserWindow>

### 1. Enable DNSSEC
Before we can integrate an existing DNS domain name with FNS we'll need to enable DNSSEC for it to establish a chain of trust between the domain name and FNS.

Not all registrars or hosting providers support DNSSEC, and some only support it as an additional paid service.

  <Image img="/img/howto/v3-integrate-dns-3.png"/>
</BrowserWindow>

Once you've enabled DNSSEC press `Check` to continue.

:::info
In order for your registrars or hosting providers DNSSEC to work with FNS it must use either `RSA/SHA-256` or `ECDSA` keys.

If they don’t, you’ll need to migrate to a DNS provider that does. See `Hosting providers` below.

#### Hosting providers
A list of popular hosting providers and which DNSSEC key types they support.[^1]

[^1]: The key-types hosting providers support may have changed since this list was last verified on `June 22nd, 2022`.

### 2. Add the TXT-record
In this step you'll need to add a TXT-record to your domain name to provide ownership of it, using your registrar or hosting provider's management interface.
<BrowserWindow url="app.fildomains.com">
  <Image img="/img/howto/v3-integrate-dns-2.png"/>
</BrowserWindow>

The DNS Registrar on FNS looks for a `TXT record` to verify ownership of the domain. This record has the following attributes:

<div align='center'>

|          |                    |
| -------- | -------------------|
| Type     | `TXT`              |
| Name     | `_ens`             |
| Contents | `a=wallet address` |
| TTL      | `36000`            |

</div>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Google DNS" default>
    <BrowserWindow url="cloud.google.com">
      <Image img="/img/howto/link-dns-name-3.webp"/>
    </BrowserWindow>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Namecheap">
    <BrowserWindow url="namecheap.com">
      <Image img="/img/howto/v3-integrate-dns-namecheap-1.png"/>
    </BrowserWindow>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

To prove ownership of your DNS name, create a `TXT record` in your DNS zone, _ens.yourdomain.xyz, with text data of the form `a=walletaddress`... where `walletaddress` is the Filecoin wallet you want to give control of the FNS record to.

### 3. Claim the DNS domain
Now you should be able to go back to the <Link to="https://app.fildomains.com"><b>FNS Manager App</b></Link> and finish linking the DNS name with FNS by pressing `Register`.

## Troubleshooting

### I’ve updated the DNS records, but it’s not proceeding to the next steps.
It can take time for record changes in DNS to propagate throughout the Internet. If you are sure the records are set properly, try waiting for some amount of time and refreshing the DNS import page.

### I've set up DNSSEC but the FNS Manager App doesn't detect it
Use a [DNSSEC Analyzer tool](https://dnssec-debugger.verisignlabs.com/) to look for errors.
