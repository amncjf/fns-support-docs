# Set a Primary name

The Primary name is your reverse record responsible for resolving your wallet address to your FNS name, helping decentralized apps and services display your FNS name based on your *Filecoin* wallet address.

In this guide we'll show you how to set up your Primary Name in just 3 steps.

Setting a name as `Primary` in your wallet is usually a simple affair, but it can be a little complicated if:
 - The name was registered using a third-party service that didn't set the `Resolver` and `FIL Address` records by default.
 - The name was purchased on a secondary market and the `FIL Address` record is still set to the previous owner's wallet.

If either of these applies to you, then you can solve it by following the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section below.

## 1. Prerequisites {#prerequisites}
:::info prerequisites
In order to set an FNS name as `Primary` there are two prerequisites:
1. The Resolver record must be set to the `FNS Public Resolver` smart contract.
1. The `FIL Address` record must be set to the wallet you're setting the `Primary` on.
:::

### 1.1. Set the Resolver {#1-set-the-resolver}
Go to your FNS name in the [FNS Manager App](https://app.fildomains.com) and scroll down to the bottom and expand `Advanced settings`.
Make sure that the `Resolver` record there is set to either of these contract addresses:

:::info
 - The **new** FNS Public Resolver contract: `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63`
 - The **old** FNS Public Resolver contract: `0x4976fb03C32e5B8cfe2b6cCB31c09Ba78EBaBa41`
   _the old FNS Public Resolver contract will continue to work and should not cause any issues._

  <div style={{'background':'#f0f6fa'}}>
    <Image img="/img/howto/set-primary-name-resolver-1.png"/>
  </div>
</BrowserWindow>

If it's unset edit it and enter the FNS Public Resolver: `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63`

### 1.2. Set the FIL Address record {#2-set-the-eth-address-record}
Go to your FNS name in the [FNS Manager App](https://app.fildomains.com) and scroll down to the `Addresses` section

<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com">
  <div style={{'background':'#f0f6fa'}}>
    <Image img="/img/howto/set-primary-name-ethaddress-1.png"/>
  </div>
</BrowserWindow>

Click `Add/Edit Record` and enter your wallet address into the `FIL Address` record field.

  <div style={{'background':'#f0f6fa'}}>
    <Image img="/img/howto/set-primary-name-ethaddress-2.png"/>
  </div>
</BrowserWindow>

Then **_scroll down_** and click `Confirm` _at the **bottom** of the address section_.

  <div style={{'background':'#f0f6fa'}}>
    <Image img="/img/howto/set-primary-name-ethaddress-3.png"/>
  </div>
</BrowserWindow>

## 2. Set the Primary Name {#set-the-primary-name}
:::caution Prerequisites
 - The FNS name must be configured with a `Resolver` record for the `Addresses`-section to appear.
 - The `FIL Address` record of the FNS name must first point to the wallet you want to set the `Primary Name` on

If either of these aren't set, please follow the instructions in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
:::

Go to the <Link to="https://app.fildomains.com"><b>FNS Manager App</b></Link> and connect your wallet.

Click `My Account` on the upper right hand side to go to your Account page. Select an FNS name from the Primary drop-down list, click `Save` and confirm the transaction in your wallet.
