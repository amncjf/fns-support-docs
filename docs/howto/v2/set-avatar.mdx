# How to set an Avatar on your FNS name
Connect to the <Link to="https://app.fildomains.com"><b>FNS Manager App</b></Link> with the wallet set as `Controller` for the FNS name you want to manage and click `Add/Edit Record`
<BrowserWindow url="app.fildomains.com">
  <Image img="/img/avatar_set1.webp"/>
</BrowserWindow>

:::info
You have three options to set the image for the avatar record:
 1. A [**Web2 URL**](#a-web2-url)
 1. An [**Filecoin NFT**](#ethereum-nft)
 1. A [**Decentralized link**](#decentralized-link)
:::

## **Web2 URL**
Many users like to use a Web2 link to their avatar image and often use <Link to="https://imgur.com"><b>Imgur</b></Link> for it. If you decide to use this method you need to make sure that you use a ***direct link*** to the image.

Make sure to right-click the image on the page and select `Copy Image Link` to get a direct link to the image instead of the default image landing page.
<BrowserWindow url="imgur.com">
  <Image img="/img/avatar_set2.webp"/>
</BrowserWindow>

It should look something like this: `https://i.imgur.com/MO1wCsI.jpg`

:::note
Keep in mind that you can't just append `.jpg` to the end of your link. You need to follow the instructions above to get the *actual* image link.

  <Image img="/img/avatar_set3.webp"/>
</BrowserWindow>

## **Filecoin NFT**
It's possible to use an Filecoin NFT as an avatar. To set an NFT as your avatar you will need to create a properly formatted address for it. For that you will need these three things:

:::note pre-requisites
 - The NFT standard of your NFT: `ERC-721` or `ERC-1155`
 - The NFT contract address
 - The NFT Token ID
:::

All these can be found on the OpenSea page for your NFT under ***Details***:
<BrowserWindow url="app.fildomains.com">
  <Image img="/img/avatar_set4.webp"/>
</BrowserWindow>

### NFT Address formatting
The correct way to create an address for your NFT is:  
**eip155:1/**`NFT Standard`**:**`NFT Contract`**/**`Token ID`

> For the NFT standard `ERC-721` or `ERC-1155` should be written in lower case without the hyphen, like this: `erc721` or `erc1155`

For example, the snow owl NFT set as the background of snowowl.fil has the following information:

|              |                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NFT Standard | `ERC-1155`                                                                      |
| NFT Contract | `0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e`                                    |
| Token ID     | `33957215644767143600642543287284327726243903296732787683908170418684512174081` |

So the properly formatted address to it would look like this:
`eip155:1/erc1155:0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/33957215644767143600642543287284327726243903296732787683908170418684512174081`

## Decentralized link
It's possible to use a direct link to an image hosted on the following decentralized protocols:

|             |          |          |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- |
| IPFS / IPNS | Arweave  | Tor      |
| Onion 3     | Bzz      | Sia      |

To use either of them set the `Content` record to the address including the protocol identifier, for example `ipfs://QmZAP51BH6xqUbnoKerm9ymmFUY1kHUVoeAYKW14Vr8RpZ` *(An image of a snow owl)*

## Avatar is set
If you've followed the instructions and set the avatar successfully it will show in the FNS Manager App
<BrowserWindow url="app.fildomains.com">
  <Image img="/img/avatar_set5.png"/>
</BrowserWindow>


## The image on the avatar doesn't cover the entire background
In order for the image set as the avatar to cover the entire background it needs to be square.
If the image appears on your avatar with a border on sides or on the top, that's because you've set an image that isn't square (of equal width and height).
