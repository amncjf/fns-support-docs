# Link a DNS name
FNS supports importing DNS names into FNS, which makes it possible to use, for example, your .com .net or .org DNS name with FNS. Allowing you to use nearly all features of an FNS name with your DNS name.

For example: Coinbase *.cb.id usernames are all issued under their `cb.id` DNS name that was imported into FNS!

There are a few pre-requisites to importing a DNS name into FNS:

 - **The DNS name must have DNSSEC enabled with RSA/SHA-256 or ECDSA keys**
 - **An _ens TXT record must be created on the DNS name containing the wallet address to prove ownership of it.**

## Hosting providers
A list of popular hosting providers and which DNSSEC key types they support[^1]

[^1]: The key-types hosting providers support may have changed since this list was last verified on `June 22nd, 2022`.

## Step 1: Enable DNSSEC

Go to the <Link to="https://app.fildomains.com"><b>FNS Manager App</b></Link> and search for your DNS name. You should see a screen like this:
<BrowserWindow url="app.fildomains.com">
  <Image img="/img/howto/link-dns-name-1.webp"/>
</BrowserWindow>

If your DNS provider supports DNSSEC, all you do is enable the option in their DNS manager:
<BrowserWindow url="support.ensmods.xyz">
  <Image img="/img/howto/link-dns-name-2.webp"/>
</BrowserWindow>

If they don’t, you’ll need to migrate to a DNS provider that does. See:
> [**Hosting providers**](#hosting-providers)

## Step 2: Add the TXT-record
The DNS Registrar on FNS looks for a `TXT record` to verify ownership of the domain. This record has the following attributes:

<div align='center'>

|          |                    |
| -------- | -------------------|
| Type     | `TXT`              |
| Name     | `_ens`             |
| Contents | `a=wallet address` |
| TTL      | `36000`            |

</div>

To prove ownership of your DNS name, create a `TXT record` in your DNS zone, _ens.yourdomain.xyz, with text data of the form `a=walletaddress`... where `walletaddress` is the Filecoin wallet you want to give control of the FNS record to.
<BrowserWindow url="support.ensmods.xyz">
  <Image img="/img/howto/link-dns-name-3.webp"/>
</BrowserWindow>

## Step 3: Linking the name with FNS
Now you should be able to go back to the <Link to="https://app.fildomains.com"><b>FNS Manager App</b></Link> and finish linking the DNS name with FNS by pressing `Register`.

</BrowserWindow>

## Troubleshooting

### I’ve updated the DNS records, but it’s not proceeding to the next steps.
It can take time for record changes in DNS to propagate throughout the Internet. If you are sure the records are set properly, try waiting for some amount of time and refreshing the DNS import page.

### I've set up DNSSEC but the FNS Manager App doesn't detect it
Use a [DNSSEC Analyzer tool](https://dnssec-debugger.verisignlabs.com/) to look for errors.
