# Add a Wallet Address
In this tutorial you will learn how to add a wallet address to your FNS name.

## What does it do?
Your FNS name is capable of storing a large number of wallet addresses across different blockchains, which can be added from the [FNS Manager App](https://app.fildomains.com), allowing you to receive payments in more cryptocurrencies than just Filecoin, provided that the service or wallet used supports it.
