# Set a Primary name
The Primary name is your reverse record responsible for resolving your wallet address to your FNS name, helping decentralized apps and services display your FNS name based on your *Filecoin* wallet address.

In this guide we'll show you how to set up your Primary Name.

Setting a name as `Primary` in your wallet is usually a simple affair, but it can be a little complicated if:
 - **The name was registered using a third-party service that didn't set the `Resolver` and `FIL Address` records by default.**
 - **The name was purchased on a secondary market and the `FIL Address` record is still set to the previous owner's wallet.**

If either of these applies to you, then you can solve it by following the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section below.

## Prerequisites
In order to set an FNS name as `Primary` there are two prerequisites:
1. **The Resolver record must be set to the `FNS Public Resolver` smart contract.**
1. **The `FIL Address` record must be set to the wallet you're setting the `Primary` on.**

### 1. Set the **Resolver** {#set-the-resolver}

<summary>Set the Resolver Record</summary>

Go to your FNS name in the [FNS Manager App](https://app.fildomains.com) and scroll down to the bottom and expand `Advanced settings`.
Make sure that the `Resolver` record there is set to either of these contract addresses:

:::info
 - The **new** FNS Public Resolver contract: `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63`
 - The **old** FNS Public Resolver contract: `0x4976fb03C32e5B8cfe2b6cCB31c09Ba78EBaBa41`
   _the old FNS Public Resolver contract will continue to work and should not cause any issues._

</BrowserWindow>

If it's unset edit it and enter the FNS Public Resolver: `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63`

### 2. Set the **FIL Address**-record {#set-the-eth-address-record}

Go to the <Link to="https://app.fildomains.com"><b>FNS Manager App</b></Link> with the wallet set as `Manager` for the FNS name you want to manage and click `Names` to bring up a list
of your FNS names *or* search for an FNS name you own directly from the main page.

Click the FNS name you want to add records to.
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" padding="25px" bg="#f5f6f7" img="/img/howto/v3-add-wallet-address-2.png"/>

Go to the `Records` tab
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" padding="25px" bg="#f5f6f7" img="/img/howto/v3-add-wallet-address-3.png"/>

Click `Edit Records`
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" padding="25px" bg="#f5f6f7" img="/img/howto/v3-add-wallet-address-4.png"/>

Switch to the `Address` tab
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" padding="25px" bg="#f5f6f7" img="/img/howto/v3-add-wallet-address-5.png"/>

Click `Add Address`
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" padding="25px" bg="#f5f6f7" img="/img/howto/v3-add-wallet-address-6.png"/>

</details>

## Set the Primary name
Click the FNS name you want to set as `Primary` in your wallet.
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" bg="#f3f4f7" img="/img/howto/v3-set-primary-name-2.png"/>

Click `Set as Primary name`
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" bg="#f3f4f7" img="/img/howto/v3-set-primary-name-3.png"/>

:::tip
If your FNS name doesn't show up in the Primary drop-down list, it's usually because the FNS name's `FIL Address` record doesn't point to your FNS name. To resolve it, see
