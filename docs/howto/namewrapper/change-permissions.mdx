# Change Name Wrapper Permissions

Revoking permissions is a `one-way` transaction that cannot be reversed (until the expiry is reached). Before changing any permissions on your name, please review these Name Wrapper sections to learn more:
* <Link to="/dev-basics/namewrapper/overview">Overview</Link>
* <Link to="/dev-basics/namewrapper/states">Wrapped States</Link>
* <Link to="/dev-basics/namewrapper/fuses">Fuses</Link>
* <Link to="/dev-basics/namewrapper/expiry">Expiry</Link>
* <Link to="/dev-basics/namewrapper/approved-operators">Approved Operators</Link>

## Permissions Tab

Once your name is wrapped in the Name Wrapper, you will have access to the `Permissions` tab in the FNS Manager App:
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" bg="#f5f6f7" padding="25px" img="/img/namewrapper-howto-permissions-1.png"/>

Note that you can only change permissions on a name if it has been <Link to="/dev-basics/namewrapper/states#emancipated">Emancipated</Link> by the parent.

Otherwise, you will see a warning like this:
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" bg="#f5f6f7" padding="25px 25px 0px 25px" img="/img/namewrapper-howto-permissions-2.png"/>

"Emancipation" means that the parent owner can no longer control the name. All .fil 2LDs (like `myname.fil`) are automatically emancipated when they are first wrapped.

## Changing Permissions

Click the `Change Permissions` button. A dialog will pop up to warn you about the changes you are about to make:
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" bg="#f5f6f7" padding="25px" img="/img/namewrapper-howto-permissions-3.png"/>

If you agree, then click `I understand` to proceed.
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" bg="#f5f6f7" padding="25px" img="/img/namewrapper-howto-permissions-4.png"/>

As explained in the <Link to="/dev-basics/namewrapper/fuses">Fuses</Link> section, in order to burn owner-controlled fuses on a name, you must <Link to="/dev-basics/namewrapper/states#locked">Lock</Link> that name first. This means that you will no longer be able to unwrap the name.

Click the "Revoke permission" button to select it, and then click `Next` to move to the next step:
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" bg="#f5f6f7" padding="25px" img="/img/namewrapper-howto-permissions-5.png"/>

You will now be able to select other permissions to revoke as you see fit.

For example, if you want to make the wrapped NFT non-transferrable, then you can revoke the "Send this name" permission.

If you only want to Lock the name, then you can click `Skip`. Otherwise, select the permissions you want to revoke, and click `Revoke` to move to the next step:
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" bg="#f5f6f7" padding="25px" img="/img/namewrapper-howto-permissions-6.png"/>

The dialog will show you the selections you made earlier. Click on `Open Wallet` to send the transaction to your wallet to approve.

Once the transaction is confirmed, click on `Done`:
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" bg="#f5f6f7" padding="25px" img="/img/namewrapper-howto-permissions-7.png"/>

The Permissions tab for your name will be updated to show which permissions you have revoked.

You can click on `Change permissions` to burn additional fuses on your name.

Or, if you want to completely "lock" the name so that no additional fuses can be burned, then click on `Revoke permission` in the top section. That will revoke the "permission to revoke permissions" itself, so that the permissions on your name can no longer be changed at all.

## Changing Subname Permissions as the Parent Owner

If you have not yet <Link to="/dev-basics/namewrapper/states#emancipated">Emancipated</Link> a subname, then as the owner of the parent, you will be able to delete the subname at any time:
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" bg="#f5f6f7" padding="25px" img="/img/namewrapper-howto-permissions-8.png"/>

Also, if your parent name is `Locked` (meaning that you cannot unwrap it), you will now be able to change permissions on any subnames underneath your name:
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" bg="#f5f6f7" padding="25px" img="/img/namewrapper-howto-permissions-9.png"/>

For example, if you want the owner of the subname to be able to extend their own expiry, then you can click on `Change permissions` and burn that fuse.

To <Link to="/dev-basics/namewrapper/states#emancipated">Emancipate</Link> a subname, click on `Give up parent control` in the top section. A dialog will pop up to warn you about the changes you are about to make:
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" bg="#f5f6f7" padding="25px" img="/img/namewrapper-howto-permissions-3.png"/>

If you agree, then click `I understand` to proceed.
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" bg="#f5f6f7" padding="25px" img="/img/namewrapper-howto-permissions-10.png"/>

Click the "Give up ownership" button to select it, and then click `Next` to move to the next step:
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" bg="#f5f6f7" padding="25px" img="/img/namewrapper-howto-permissions-11.png"/>

As explained in the <Link to="/dev-basics/namewrapper/expiry">Expiry</Link> section, when you burn fuses on a name, you must also set an expiry for it at the same time.

The maximum expiry you can set on a name is the expiry of the parent name. You can select `Max` to do this. Otherwise, you can select `Choose an earlier date` to set a different expiry.

Once you've made your choice, click `Next` to move to the next step:
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" bg="#f5f6f7" padding="25px" img="/img/namewrapper-howto-permissions-12.png"/>

In this step, select which other permissions you want to change on the subname, if any. Note that once you give up control over this subname, you will `no longer be able to change any permissions`.

Some of the permissions are greyed-out in the dialog by default. That's because if you want to revoke them, you must also <Link to="/dev-basics/namewrapper/states#locked">Lock</Link> the subname at the same time. If you wish to do that, then click on "Revoke permission to: Unwrap this name", and then select any other permissions you want to change.

If you only want to Emancipate the name, then you can click `Skip`. Otherwise, select the permissions you want to revoke, and click `Revoke` to move to the next step:
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" bg="#f5f6f7" padding="25px" img="/img/namewrapper-howto-permissions-13.png"/>

The dialog will show you the selections you made earlier. Click on `Open Wallet` to send the transaction to your wallet to approve.

Once the transaction is confirmed, click on `Done`:
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" bg="#f5f6f7" padding="25px" img="/img/namewrapper-howto-permissions-14.png"/>

The Permissions tab for the subname will be updated to show which permissions you have revoked.

For example in this case, the subname was Emancipated and Locked, meaning:
* The parent owner can no longer control the subname
* The subname can no longer be unwrapped

The <Link to="/dev-basics/namewrapper/fuses#parent-controlled-fuses">Extend Expiry</Link> permission was also granted, meaning:
* The owner of the subname can now extend their own Expiry

Finally, the <Link to="/dev-basics/namewrapper/fuses#owner-controlled-fuses">Create Subnames</Link> permission was also revoked, meaning:
* The owner of the subname cannot create further subnames underneath their name (like `further.sub.name.fil`).

On the Profile tab for the subname, you'll also see that you no longer have the ability to delete the subname:
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.fildomains.com" bg="#f5f6f7" padding="25px" img="/img/namewrapper-howto-permissions-15.png"/>
