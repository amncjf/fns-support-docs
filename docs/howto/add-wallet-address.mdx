# Add a Wallet Address
In this tutorial you will learn how to add a wallet address to your ENS name.

## What does it do?
Your ENS name is capable of storing a large number of wallet addresses across different blockchains, which can be added from the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains), allowing you to receive payments in more cryptocurrencies than just Ethereum, provided that the service or wallet used supports it.

## Add an **Ethereum** wallet {#ethereum-wallet}
In this section you will learn how to add an Ethereum wallet to your ENS name. This is the wallet ETH will end up in when sent to your ENS name.
It also is a prerequisite to setting the `Primary name` in a wallet.

of your ENS names *or* search for an ENS name you own directly from the main page.
