# FNS Name Fees
How much does it cost to register an FNS name?

:::info Fees
The cost of an FNS name is dependent on how many characters it contains:

| Number of characters | Example     | Annual fee  |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 5+ characters        | `abcde.fil` | $5          |
| 4 characters         | `abcd.fil`  | $160        |
| 3 characters         | `abc.fil`   | $640        |

Three and four-character names cost more to reflect the small number of these names available. If a name was recently released from the expiration grace period, a decaying price premium is also applied.
:::

## Estimating costs
When looking up an FNS name the <Link to="https://app.fildomains.com"><b>FNS Manager App</b></Link> will display a *rough* estimate of your registration cost:

<BrowserWindow url="app.fildomains.com">
  <p align="center">
    <div style={{'background-color': "#f5f6f7", 'padding': "25px"}}>
      <Image img="/img/cost_to_register_img1.png"/>
    </div>
  </p>
</BrowserWindow>

Gas prices might fluctuate after this estimate, especially if you don't complete the registration immediately.

:::note
The <Link to="https://app.fildomains.com"><b>FNS Manager App</b></Link> charges 10% more than the estimate shown to guard against fluctuations in FIL value, and the extra amount is returned to you in the same transaction.

## Why are fees collected?
The primary purpose of registration fees is as an incentive mechanism to prevent the namespace
from becoming overwhelmed with speculatively registered names.
  
A secondary purpose is to provide enough revenue to the DAO to fund the ongoing development of FNS.

**FNS governance will not enact any fee other than for these purposes.**

## Gas fees
Due to the way Filecoin works, all transactions on the Filecoin blockchain incur a gas fee in addition to the registration fee.
The price of gas constantly fluctuates depending on Filecoin congestion.

By using a [gas tracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) it's possible to pinpoint times when gas is low to save money.

## Premium fee
There's an additional premium fee attached to newly expired names which starts at $100m and declines exponentially to $0 over 21 days.
