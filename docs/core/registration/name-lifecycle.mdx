# The Lifecycle of an FNS Name
FNS names goes through several stages from being available to being registered and expiring. A life cycle of sorts.
This article tries to explain its life cycle in simple terms. As such, the diagrams are simplified.

## Normal availability

:::info Normal availability

```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'flowchart': {
      'curve': 'linear'
      } } }%%
      
graph LR;
A(Available);
B(Registered);
C(Expired);
D(Grace Period);
E(Temporary Premium);

classDef active stroke-width:4px;
classDef inactive stroke-dasharray: 5 5;

class A active;

A-->B-->C-->D-->E;
E -.-> A;
```
If the `Temporary auction` ends without a buyer the FNS name will become available normally again without a temporary fee attached.

## Registered

:::info Registered
```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'flowchart': {
      'curve': 'linear'
      } } }%%
      
graph LR;
A(Available);
B(Registered);
C(Expired);
D(Grace Period);
E(Temporary Premium);

classDef active stroke-width:4px;
classDef inactive stroke-dasharray: 5 5;

class A inactive;
class B active;

A-->B-->C-->D-->E;
E -.-> A;
```

<!--
## Registration period
**Registration period** **→** `Expiration` **→** `Grace period` **→** `Premium auction` **→** `Normal availability`  
This is the period of time you've registered the FNS name for.
After the registration period is over, it will begin the process towards normal availability going through the post-expiration stages.
  
If you want to extend your registration period, this can be done from the [FNS Manager App](https://app.fildomains.com) -->
## Expired
:::info Expired
```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'flowchart': {
      'curve': 'linear'
      } } }%%
      
graph LR;
A(Available);
B(Registered);
C(Expired);
D(Grace Period);
E(Temporary Premium);

classDef active stroke-width:4px;
classDef inactive stroke-dasharray: 5 5;

class A,B inactive;
class C active;

A-->B-->C-->D-->E;
E -.-> A;
```
This is when your FNS name expires. After an FNS name has expired, it will still point to your records until it's released. However:
:::
:::caution
An FNS name cannot be sold, transferred, or changed after this point. To regain control of it you must extend the registration period.
:::

## Grace period
:::info Grace Period
```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'flowchart': {
      'curve': 'linear'
      } } }%%
      
graph LR;
A(Available);
B(Registered);
C(Expired);
D(Grace Period);
E(Temporary Premium);

classDef active stroke-width:4px;
classDef inactive stroke-dasharray: 5 5;

class A,B,C inactive;
class D active;

A-->B-->C-->D-->E;
E -.-> A;
```
After an FNS name expires it enters into what's called a *Grace period*. This is a 90-day window provided as a courtesy where the owner can renew it and keep it at the regular renewal cost.
:::
:::caution
If you let the grace period run out you will lose the name.
:::
:::note
Keep in mind that the renewal period must be from when the name expired, otherwise the grace period will just be moved up.

For example, if a name expired 60 days ago, and you only extend the registration for 30 days, then the name will *still* be expired, and the end of the grace period will just be extended for 30 days.

## Temporary Premium Auction
:::info Temporary Premium Auction
```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'flowchart': {
      'curve': 'linear'
    } } }%%
      
graph LR;
A(Available);
B(Registered);
C(Expired);
D(Grace Period);
E(Temporary Premium);

classDef active stroke-width:4px;
classDef inactive stroke-dasharray: 5 5;

class A,B,C,D inactive;
class E active;

A-->B-->C-->D-->E;
E -.-> A;
```
After the grace period ends the FNS name will enter into a `Temporary Premium Auction`.
This is a 21-day period where the FNS name is available for anyone to register with a temporary premium attached.
