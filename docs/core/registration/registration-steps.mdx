# Registration Steps

There are three steps involved in registering an FNS name that is intended to mitigate the problem of front-running.

Front-running an FNS name would be possible if registration happened in one transaction.
Someone could “see” the single registration transaction in the mempool, and send the same transaction but with higher gas so the transaction they sent settles first.

In essence, “sniping” the name before registration completes. For this reason, FNS name registrations rely on a `Reveal-Commitment Scheme`.

## Step 1: Request to register
```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'flowchart': {
      'curve': 'linear'
    } } }%%
      
graph LR;
A(Request to Register);
B(Wait 60 Seconds);
C(Register);

classDef active stroke-width:4px;
classDef inactive stroke-dasharray: 5 5;

class A active;

A-->B-->C;
```

The commit in Step 1 hashes a secret key generated and stored in your browser's local storage and hashes it with your wallet address and FNS name so that you can later register it without revealing it publicly.

Only the user knows the values of the cryptographic hash.

Once you've performed the `Request to Register` you have 7 days to complete Step 3 until the `Request to Register` becomes invalid.
:::info
No registration fees are collected in this step. The fees are only for gas to save the commit transaction on-chain.
:::

:::caution
 - Keep in mind that while you have 7 days to complete the name registration, the name is ***not*** reserved for you during this time.
 - Clearing your browser cache will lose the saved commit, and start the registration process over again.

## Step 2: Wait for 1 minute
```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'flowchart': {
      'curve': 'linear'
    } } }%%
      
graph LR;
A(Request to Register);
B(Wait 60 Seconds);
C(Register);

classDef active stroke-width:4px;
classDef inactive stroke-dasharray: 5 5;

class A inactive;
class B active;

A-->B-->C;
```

A 1 minute waiting period begins to prevent the front-running of the FNS name registration. This wait period acts as a “buffer” so that in the final step, the revealed FNS name’s registration cannot be front-run with a higher gas transaction.

## Step 3: Register
```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'flowchart': {
      'curve': 'linear'
    } } }%%
      
graph LR;
A(Request to Register);
B(Wait 60 Seconds);
C(Register);

classDef active stroke-width:4px;
classDef inactive stroke-dasharray: 5 5;

class A,B inactive;
class C active;

A-->B-->C;
```

The FNS name registration is revealed on-chain. Once the registration transaction is performed and the FNS name is registered; the ERC-721 NFT for the FNS name is minted and transferred into the owner's wallet.

## In conclusion
If a miner wanted to try and front-run this process, they would have to send their own hashed secret, wait 1 minute and then register the name. Since The 3 step registration process works because they can't hold back your transaction for one minute, they will fail to do so, and the miner can't use the secret compared to the earlier hash.
