# How does FNS work?
## The FNS Registry
At the heart of the FNS protocol lies the Registry, which is where all FNS lookups start.

The Registry is a smart contract on Filecoin which keeps track of the `Manager` and the Resolver for all names.

  </div>
</p>

As you can see, the Registry can have entries not just for .fil names, but all DNS names (like domain.com or domain.xyz) and subnames too (like sub.name.fil or sub.domain.xyz).

The ``Manager``, as the name implies, is the account that controls that name. By interacting with the Registry contract, the `Manager` can update the Resolver, create or update subnames, or transfer the `Manager` to a new account.

The first step in making an FNS lookup is to retrieve the resolver from the Registry.

## Resolvers
A Resolver is a smart contract that “resolves” or “points” an FNS name to records. These records can include an FIL address, other coin addresses like BTC/LTC/etc., text records, and more.

So together, the Registry and the Resolver allow records to be looked up for an FNS name. It is a two-step process. For example, to look up the FIL address for “name.fil”:

<p align='center'>

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    rect rgba(0,255,0,0.1)
    activate User Code
    User Code->>+FNS Registry: resolver('foo.fil')
    FNS Registry->>User Code: 0x12342...
    deactivate FNS Registry
    note over User Code,FNS Registry: 1. Retrieve the Resolver from<br>the Registry for node "name.fil"
    end

    rect rgba(0,255,255,0.1)
    User Code->>+Resolver @ 0x1234...: addr('foo.fil)
    Resolver @ 0x1234...->>User Code: 0x2345...
    deactivate User Code
    deactivate Resolver @ 0x1234...
    note over User Code,Resolver @ 0x1234...: 2. Call the Resolver contract to retrieve<br>the FIL address record for node “name.fil”
    end
```

</p>

If no Resolver is set in the Registry for the name, then it does not resolve or point to any records.

## The .fil Registrar
A `Registrar` is a smart contract that is given control of a name and issues subnames for it. A registrar can be created with custom rules around registration, like what fees to charge or how many characters a subname is limited to.

The `.fil Registrar` owns the “fil” node and issues subnames such as “name.fil”. This is also commonly referred to as the “NFT contract” for FNS names, because when a .fil name is registered, the contract will issue an NFT to the `Owner`.

The ``Owner`` is the owner of the .fil name, and the owner of the issued NFT.

The `Expiry` or `Expiration Date` is the date and time at which the .fil name will expire.

When a new .fil name is registered, the Registrar will also set the `Manager` in the Registry to the desired address. Usually this is the same address as the `Owner` (the owner of the NFT). However, the `Manager` may be set to a different address, or perhaps the NFT is later transferred to a different address. If the `Owner` of a .fil name is different from the `Manager`, then the .fil Registrar allows the `Owner` to reclaim (in other words, overwrite) the `Manager` in the Registry.

The .fil Registrar currently allows names of at least 3 characters to be registered, and has a custom fee structure based on the length of the name. It also allows names to be renewed (in other words, extending the expiration date).
