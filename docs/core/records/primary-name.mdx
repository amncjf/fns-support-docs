# The Primary name

## How name resolution works

The Primary name is your reverse record responsible for resolving your wallet address to your FNS name, effectively helping DApps and other services display your FNS name based on your *Filecoin* wallet address.

The easiest way to understand it is to consider that name resolution works in two directions:

### Forward resolution
```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'flowchart': {
      'curve': 'linear'
      } } }%%
      
graph LR;
A(Your FNS Name);
B(Your wallet address);

A-->B;
```
Forward resolution is simply where your name points to and is determined by the `FIL Address` record set on your FNS name.

### Reverse resolution
```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'flowchart': {
       'curve': 'linear'
      } } }%%

graph LR;
A(Your FNS Name);
B(Your wallet address);

B-->A;
```
Reverse resolution is where your wallet points to and is determined by the `Primary name` record set in your wallet.
