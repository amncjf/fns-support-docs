## What does it do?
The `FIL` Address record is one of the main records of your FNS name. It determines where Filecoin funds sent to it ends up, as well as providing the `forward resolution` required when setting up a <Link to="/core/records/primary-name"><b>Primary name</b></Link>.

If you find that an FNS name you own doesn't show up in the Primary Name drop-down list for your wallet, it's usually because the `FIL Address` record isn't set to it.
