# The Content record
One of the most interesting and powerful features of FNS names is the ability to point them to webpages hosted on the decentralized web. This is achieved by creating a website where both the hosting and the domain name is entirely decentralized, meaning that neither is hosted on any one server.

## What does it do?
The Content record lets you point your FNS name to a decentralized resource. The location that record resolves to will allow a user to enter your FNS name into their browser's address bar and display your decentralized website.

:::info Compatible Browsers
For FNS resolution in the browser address bar to work, the browser needs to be compatible with FNS or have the Metamask extension installed.

### FNS Compatible browsers
Some browsers which are more oriented towards Web3 support FNS right out of the box:
 - <Link to="https://brave.com"><b>Brave Browser</b></Link>
 - <Link to="https://www.opera.com"><b>Opera Browser</b></Link>
 
Other browsers will need to have an extension installed for it to work, such as the Metamask browser extension:
 - <Link to="https://www.google.com/chrome"><b>Google Chrome</b></Link>
 - <Link to="https://www.mozilla.org"><b>Mozilla Firefox</b></Link>
