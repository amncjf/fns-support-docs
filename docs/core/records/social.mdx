# Social media records
The FNS Manager App contains several standard record fields which you can use to provide various social media and development accounts. Any amount of custom records can also be created.

:::caution Note
**These services do not yet have FNS integration, so changing the records will only affect certain custom services that look this information up.**
:::

## Changing my Twitter name
Twitter does not *yet* have FNS integration, so to change your Twitter name to display your FNS name you'd simply go to your profile and change your name to your FNS name.

:::

## Changing my Discord name
FNS provides a Discord record: `com.discord` which can be used to provide your Discord username to anyone who looks up your FNS name. An example use case is to verify that the FNS name is owned by a specific Discord user.

To set it, enter your username excluding the *@* but including the digits at the end. For example `User#1234`
