# Things you can do with your FNS name
This article is a list of things you can use your FNS name for.

## An easy to remember name for your wallets
The first and most common use case for an FNS name is to use it as an easy-to-remember name for your cryptocurrency addresses.
FNS supports many different cryptocurrencies which can be added from the [FNS Manager App](https://app.fildomains.com), allowing you to receive payments in more cryptocurrencies than just Filecoin.

This alleviates the confusion associated with remembering your hexadecimal wallet address and provides easy payment options.

### And also for everything else
FNS names go far beyond that, however, allowing you to add all kinds of records to it from social media links, to profile pictures, custom records, and decentralized websites.
This gives you a name that can serve as your complete Web3 identity.

## Connect metadata to your Web3 identity
Your FNS name can store metadata like your e-mail address, website and social media usernames so people can easily find them.

### And provide it to apps and services!
Services like games, apps and other websites can then fetch the metadata and display it so you don't have to maintain individual profiles on each service!

<!--
FNS Names support numerous text records which can be used to provide on-chain metadata to connect to your social media accounts. For example, you can add your Twitter or Discord handles to your FNS records.
-->

### Social media identity
A popular use-case for FNS names is to use them as your online identity on social media:

    <div class="col-sm-4"><Image img="/img/twitter-alisha.png"/></div>
    <div class="col-sm-4"><Image img="/img/twitter-jeff.png"/></div>

### URLs and E-Mail  
 *Your FNS name can store your e-mail and website addresses so people can easily find them.*

### E-Mail
While FNS names cannot be used in legacy DNS-based e-mail systems, there are several projects which works around that to enable you to use your FNS name to send and receive e-mail!

 - [EtherMail](https://ethermail.io/)
 - [Skiff Mail](https://skiff.com/mail)

### Custom Service Keys 
Your FNS name is also capable of storing custom records that can contain nearly anything you want to display or integrate into your services.

## Create a Decentralized Website
One of the most interesting and powerful features of FNS names is the ability to point them to webpages hosted on the decentralized web, creating a website where both the hosting and the domain name is *entirely* decentralized.
