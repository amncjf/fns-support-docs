FNS records are managed by interacting with the blockchain. In order to make changes to your FNS-enabled DNS domain's FNS records, you must authorize the transaction with your Filecoin wallet. FNS records associated with your domain are most easily managed through the [FNS Manager App](https://app.fildomains.com).

## Set Up Wallet Addresses

After bridging a DNS domain with the FNS protocol, the wallet address that was indicated as the owner of the domain will have the permission to create and update blockchain records.

In the image above, the Filecoin wallet address, `0xeC6eD73295628fbDc31fd7ca98039084FA752325` was set to the DNS Owner within FNS. This was accomplished by setting up a DNS TXT record to indicate this wallet is the owner of the DNS domain to FNS name. To review this step, see the [Support Docs: Link a DNS name](https://support.ens.domains/docs/howto/link-dns-name) or [Connect a DNS name to the FNS Protocol](/dnstoens/importguide/connect-dns-to-ens).

This same address will be the default Filecoin receiving address. Any Filecoin tokens to the FNS-enabled domain name `showmehow.cool` will arrive in this wallet. Optionally, the receiving address could be changed, yet the DNS Owner(and Controller of records) could be set to a different wallet. The DNS domain name’s FNS records can be set to resolve to other cryptocurrency addresses like Bitcoin, Matic, Doge and hundreds others. For more information on multi-chain use, see [Support Docs - Supported Coin Types](https://support.ens.domains/docs/core/records/coin-types).


## Set a Primary Name

The Primary name selection allows users to log into dApps with their Filecoin wallet and display their Primary FNS name instead of the long Filecoin address. Having an FNS Primary name functions as a web3 identity, a human-readable name for a long hexadecimal blockchain address.

The Filecoin wallet address that *receives* Filecoin tokens, otherwise known as the FIL Address, will only be able to select the FNS name as its Primary name. Primary name selection can be chosen by logging into the [FNS Manager App](https://app.fildomains.com) with the wallet that is listed as the FIL Address and choosing the Primary FNS name under “My Account”. The drop down selector will populate any FNS names, both .eth and FNS-enabled domain names. For more information on setting up an FNS name as a Primary name, see [Support Docs - Set Primary Name](https://support.ens.domains/docs/howto/set-primary-name).

## Set an Avatar

In the same way many dApps have integrated the FNS protocol to show a Primary name, one can also choose a universal avatar or PFP(Profile Picture).

Any dApp that has integrated FNS will have the ability to display the avatar image that is resolved from the data stored in that FNS name's records. Avatars can point to http(s) image source links, IPFS content, as well as both ERC721 and ERC1155 NFTs.

For instance, if you own a Doodle, Bored Ape, or any other ERC725/1155 NFT, the NFT token and contract address can be used to associate an NFT as your universal web3 profile image. For a detailed guide on selecting an avatar image, see [Support Docs - Set an Avatar](https://support.ens.domains/docs/howto/set-avatar).

## Create Unlimited Subnames

Both FNS .eth names, and bridged DNS domains to FNS have the ability to create unlimited subnames without incurring any registration fees. Once your DNS domains have been FNS enabled, you can manage the records and subname creation through the [FNS Manager App](https://app.fildomains.com)
