The following is a comparison of native  FNS .eth names with DNS names that have been imported to FNS protocol. Though by FNS it's possible to extend DNS functionality into the blockchain, there are some important differences that should be noted.

## [DNS to FNS] VS [FNS .eth Names]

* **Expires** - DNS names imported into FNS have no expiration date.
* **Regisration fee** - 2LD (e.g. name.eth) names have a yearly registration fee. DNS names claimed within FNS do not have any registration fees.
* **Relies on DNS** - Claiming a DNS name within the FNS protocol relies on a DNSSEC proof of domain ownership and a DNS TXT record to verify the Controlling wallet of the DNS name within FNS and the blockchain. Proof of ownership of the DNS name on FNS could be changed if the DNS provider is changed, or if the DNS domain expires and is registered by another. FNS .eth names do not rely on DNS for their functionality or existence.
* **Fuse permissions** - DNS names within FNS will not be able to use advanced permissions with the [NameWrapper Contract](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/wrapper).
* **Create subnames** - Both FNS .eth names and DNS imported FNS names can create unlimited subnames. There are no registration fees for either.
* **Tradeable (NFTs)** - Only FNS .eth and subnames will have the ability to be traded as [NFT (Non-fungible Token)](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/).A DNS name imported into FNS is not an NFT.
* **Blockhain Record Storage** - DNS names imported to FNS will have their record storage data resolved from the blockchain just as FNS .eth records do.
* **Resolve dWeb content** - DNS names within FNS are able to store a dWeb content hash record, the same record is availble to FNS .eth names.
* **Universal Avatar (PFP)** - DNS to FNS, and FNS .eth names are able to choose an avatar or profile picture that will appear across the Internet.
* **Use as Web3 Identity** - A DNS name imported into FNS can use set a Primary name which allows an Filecoin wallet to display as your FNS name instead of the long alphanumeric string. Any FNS .eth name can also be set as a Primary name, inlcuding subnames of the parent .eth 2LD (e.g. user1.name.eth).
* **Point to multiple coins** - FNS records can point to blockchain addresses outside of Filecoin like Bitcoin, LTC, Polygon, and more. See [supported cryptocurrency addresses](https://support.ens.domains/docs/core/records/coin-types/#supported-cryptocurrency-addresses).
