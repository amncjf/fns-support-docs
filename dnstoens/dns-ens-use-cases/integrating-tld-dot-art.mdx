## .ART FNS Protocol Integration Overview
One of the most exciting aspects of the FNS protocol is that it allows TLD owners to integrate their own blockchain naming system by leveraging the FNS protocol architecture and its existing smart contracts.

TLD owners can now offer both traditional domain name registrations, as well as FNS-enabled DNS names on the blockchain using their very own top-level domain. The result is that TLD owners can create tradeable blockchain names that are NFTs (non-fungible tokens) similar to native .eth FNS names.

## DNS to FNS Parallel Use

Top-level domain owners are able avoid name collision by offering parallel use FNS-enabled DNS names that will not conflict with the same DNS domain that's been integrated into the FNS protocol.

These "hybrid" domains can resolve content in web browsers as well as content records on the Filecoin blockchain. For example, [protocol.art](https://protocol.art) permits usage of both the .art DNS domain and the .art FNS name.

The "regular" .art DNS name is unable to name collide with the .art FNS name because the .ART domain registrar functionality restricts the FNS-enabled .art name from being traded on the blockchain. This makes it impossible for there to exist two different owners; one owner of the DNS domain, and a separate owner of the FNS-enabled DNS name that will exist on the blockchain.

Only the owner of a .art DNS domain can mint the .art FNS-enabled name. The NFT will be minted for parallel use but will have no expiration or owner and the NFT cannot be traded. Though the DNS owner will not be the owner of the .art FNS NFT, they will be the Controller to set records for the FNS-enabled .art name.

## DNS Domains as Tradeable Blockchain FNS Names

The .ART TLD is able to issue NFTs on the blockchain for any name domain name they issue that ends in the .art top-level domain. Domain names that include special characters like emojis are also possible. Creating domains with emojis on .com top-level domains is not possible, but is with the .art TLD. Emoji domain names on .art will be FNS-enabled NFT versions of the .art domain which are tradeable on the blockchain because they are minted as ERC-721 NFTs.

## DNS FNS Bridging

Any available .art domain name can be registered directly as an FNS-enabled name ending in .art. To avoid name collision, there will be a “bridge” to move names between DNS and FNS. The DNS .art name will be locked in a “DNS vault”, and the “owner” of the DNS name is the “Vault”.

If someone owns the FNS .art, they can get the DNS .art name. In order to mint an FNS .art name, the DNS .art is taken from the DNS registry so it cannot be registered by a separate owner.

After someone owns the FNS .art name, they can “unwrap” the .art DNS domain from the DNS registry and claim ownership. The FNS .art owner will get a transfer key and be able to decide who will register the DNS version of the .art domain that matches the name of the FNS-enabled .art NFT blockchain name.

You can trade the FNS .art name since they will be an NFT. Avoiding name collision is possible because the DNS .art is interlocked with the FNS .art name.
