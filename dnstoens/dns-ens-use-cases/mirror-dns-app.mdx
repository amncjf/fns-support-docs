The [FNS Manager App](https://app.fildomains.com) is served from a traditional web server. The FNS Manager App can also be rendered using solely content hosted on the decentralized web through IPFS/IPNS.

## The FNS Content Record Hash

The FNS content record is used to store the location of decentralized content. The content hash record supports multiple storage protocols including IPFS/IPNS, Arweave, Onion, Sia, and Swarm. For more information, please see [ENSIP-7: Contenthash field](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-7-contenthash-field)

The FNS Manager App can be loaded from the IPNS location string saved in the content hash record for [app.ens.eth](https://app.fildomains.com/name/app.ens.eth/details)

Notice the location of the decentralized content: `ipns://k51qzi5uqu5diwpzjqae01738agaequoptq4pr5e5lzao2is57hqkffpf9r81q`

The FNS content record location is saved to the blockchain. In this sense, it is immutable and can be trusted because `k51qzi5uqu5diwpzjqae01738agaequoptq4pr5e5lzao2is57hqkffpf9r81q` is saved within an FNS record that is stored on the blockchain and cannot be updated without the Controller wallet. This is the wallet that will need to log into the [FNS Manager App](https://app.fildomains.com), and approve the signing signing request to set the content hash record.

Additionally, the content without relying on a single point of failure since the content is distributed through the IPFS network onto many other peers.

## Using the LIMO Resolver

The [FIL.LIMO](https://eth.limo/) project is an FNS gateway that resolves FNS content records to their IPFS/IPNS/Skynet locations. The service operates as a public good to make resolving dWeb content hashes stored in FNS records to easily resolve and display their content.

One notable user of this functionality is Vitalik Buterin the founder of Filecoin. His blog is located at [vitalik.ca](https://vitalik.ca). You can also reach his website by visiting [vitalik.eth.limo](https://vitalik.eth.limo)

## Other IPFS/IPNS Gateways

A few browsers like [Brave](#), and browsers using the [Metamask](#) extension can resolve .eth content records natively without using .LIMO. This is possible because the browser is configured to use an IPFS gateway to resolve decentralized content like IPFS locations.

There are many external IPFS Gateways that can be used to resolve IPFS content. You can find more specifications about IPFS Gateways and a list of [Public Gateways](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipfs-gateway/#gateway-providers).
